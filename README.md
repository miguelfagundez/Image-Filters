# Image-Filters
CS50 exercise (Applying image filters - Sepia, Grayscale, Reflec, and Blur) - Week04


## Filters
This is a simple implementation of a program that apply some filters to an image. This is part of the 
[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) exercises.

Example:

```
$ ./filter -g infile.bmp outfile.bmp
$ ./filter -s infile.bmp outfile.bmp
$ ./filter -r infile.bmp outfile.bmp
$ ./filter -b infile.bmp outfile.bmp

g: Grayscale
s: Sepia
r: Reflect
b: Blur
```
For example, a blur result is showed as follow:
<p align = "center">
<img src="/images/tower.bmp" width="450"> <img src="/out.bmp" width="450">
</p>
